# p5-Graphics-Assignment-3
Graphics assignment that introduces animation in p5 (JavaScript) for "Programming Digital media"

A right-facing standing sprite appears at the top left. A basic walking-to-the-right animation is visible along the top. Each sprite is 80 pixels square.

Implement an object that draws an animated character that can stand, walk to the right, and walk to the left. Use the scale() function to provide left-facing animation using the sprites of the right-facing animation. Try to ensure that the animation frame rate is appropriate for the artwork, and make sure that the characters feet appear to remain planted while walking.

Instantiate several of these walking characters at random positions on the screen. Let the user control the motion of the group using the left and right arrow keys.

These sprite sheets were found at The Spriters Resource

Given a correctly-implemented character object, it should be trivial to add more character sprite sheets, so take your pick and add at least one more.
ZIP your sketch directory with the HTML file, JS file, and sprite PNGs, and attach that to your Moodle submission. As always, be sure to indent your code correctly. Feel free to discuss this implementation with your classmates, but don't share code.
